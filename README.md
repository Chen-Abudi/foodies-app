## 🔎 Intro:

This is a **Full-Stack** application developed with NextJS, showcasing a foodies app that allows to view meals recipes, share them, and be part of a foodies community.

## 🧰 Tech Stack:

- NextJS
- ReactJS
- JavaScript
- SQL & SQLite3 Database
- CSS Modules
- Responsive Layout
- Slugify
- XSS Protection

## 🛠️ Techniques & Tools:

- Custom Components
- Dynamic Routes
- Images Slideshow
- **`Next Client Component Hook`**:
  - **_usePathname_**: Is a hook that lets you read the current URL's pathname.
- **`React Router Dom Components`**:
  - **_NavLink_**: Is used for navigation between pages.
- **_Loading_**
- **`React Components`**:
  - **_Suspense_**: Is a built-in React component which lets us temporarily render a fallback UI while its children are still loading.
- Handling Errors + Not Found Page
- **`React Hooks`**:

  - **_useRef_**: Is a hook that lets you reference a value that's not needed for rendering.
  - **_useFormStatus_**: Is a hook that provides status information of the last form submission.
  - **_useFormState_**: Is a custom hook that allows you to subscribe to each form state, and isolate the re-render at the custom hook level.

  **`Note`**: It has its scope in terms of form state subscription, so it would not affect other **useFormState** and **useForm**. Using this hook can reduce the re-render impact on large and complex form applications.

- Server Side Validation
